# Prerequisites

You need to have libcdio and its headers installed in order to build this crate.

# Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

    [dependencies]
    libcdio-sys = "0.5"

Then, add the following to your crate root:

    extern crate libcdio_sys;

By default, `libcdio-sys` will link to libcdio, libiso9660 and libudf. You can control which libraries are linked using the following:

    [dependencies]
    libcdio-sys = { version = "0.5", default-features = false, features = ["cdio"] }

In this example, only libcdio is used. Valid features are: `cdio`, `iso9660` and `udf`.
