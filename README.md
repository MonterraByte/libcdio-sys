# Prerequisites

You need to have libcdio and its headers installed in order to build this crate.

# Usage

Run `cargo add libcdio-sys`, or add `libcdio-sys = "0.5"` to the `[dependencies]` section of your Cargo.toml.

libcdio is split into multiple libraries: `libcdio`, `libiso9660` and `libudf`. (Likewise, libcdio-paranoia is split into `libcdio_cdda` and `libcdio_paranoia`.) The `libcdio-sys` crate always links against `libcdio`, and can link against the others depending on which Cargo features are enabled.

The available Cargo features are `iso9660`, `udf`, `cdda` and `paranoia`. The first two are enabled by default; the last two require libcdio-paranoia, which is usually installed separately from libcdio.
